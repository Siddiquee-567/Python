# Python
# slot machine
This code implements a simple slot machine game in Python. The game starts with an initial balance
of $100 and allows the user to place bets and spin the machine. The spin result is randomly gener-
ated and determines the payout based on the bet amount. The game continues until the balance
reaches zero, and the user is asked if they want to play again. The code uses classes and methods to
organize the game logic and user interactions.
